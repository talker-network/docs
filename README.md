### Fundamental Concepts: Users and Channels

**Users** and **Channels** are the fundamental building blocks of the Talker SDK. They provide the structure for organizing and managing communication within the platform.

* **Users** represent individual entities within the Talker system. Each user has a unique identifier and specific name. Users are authenticated to access the Talker platform, ensuring that only authorized individuals can participate in communications. Users may have different  roles within channels , allowing for granular control over access and privileges. Users can create and participate in channels and engage in real-time push-to-talk interactions.
* **Channels** serve as dedicated spaces for communication between users. Channels provide a way to organize and manage conversations based on specific topics, interests, or groups of people. Users can join or leave channels, and channel administrators can manage membership and permissions. \
